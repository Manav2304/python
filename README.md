# Project Title

**KMeans Clustering**

---

## Description

This project provides an interactive tutorial on KMeans clustering, aimed at helping data enthusiasts understand clustering concepts and implement them using Python. The tutorial includes code examples, practical demonstrations, and visualizations to ensure comprehensive learning.

---

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the **Deployment** section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

---

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following software installed:

- **Python 3.x**: Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Install via pip or Anaconda.
- **Required Libraries**: Install using pip:
```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
## Installing

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manav2304/python.git
```
**Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory**
```bash
cd python
```
**Step 3: Launch Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
**Step 4: Open the Notebook**

In Jupyter Notebook, open KMeans.ipynb to start working with the project.

## Running the Tests

End-to-End Tests

These tests verify the functionality of the clustering implementation from data preprocessing to cluster visualization.

Example test:

```bash
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])

# Running KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0).fit(data)
assert len(kmeans.labels_) == len(data)
```
## Deployment
To deploy this project on a live system, consider converting the Jupyter Notebook into a standalone Python script or hosting it on a Jupyter Notebook server. 

Use the following command to export as a Python script:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script KMeans.ipynb
```
